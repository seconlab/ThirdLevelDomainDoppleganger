    "I was going down the path of looking at string length differences between the paired domain names and the 2nd and 3rd level, and ideally, a good measure would be the distance of the two complete instances excluding any delimiters.  So, for www and domain, wwwdomain.com and www-domain.com should be considered equally suspicious, because when you exclude the delimiter in the comparison, both are zero.  This is important because in order to find a match for the burisma case, the delimiter used is \"-my-\".  But, how does an algorithm know that \"-my-\" is a delimiter. My first thought is to do a frequency analysis of the quadgrams for all .com domain names, and then see where they differ from English language.  \n",

    "\n",
    "I'm going to do a frequency count of domain names, starting with maybe 4 or 5 characters and see what I come up with.  If I'm correct, the \"-my-\" should be high in the list of most popular quadgrams.  for the trigrams, it will be interesting to see where www ends up.  For the monograms, I expect to see dash be the most frequent non alpha character used.  I'm curious to see if it beats out numbers.\n"
